## Collaboration
I worked together with Karl Wennerstr√∂m, Erik Bengtssonoch and Mathias Schmekel. We discussed the problem together and also collaborated while writing the code.

I also took inspiration from the solutions to different problems provided by professor Giovanni Squillero in the GitHub repository "computational-intelligence". Specifically the solution called "8-puzzle.ipynb", "4-friends.ipynb".

## Code
The code first sort the list generated by the problem function by ordering the sublist from least unique elements to most unique elements compared to the current state. The current state contains all the elements of the previusly added from sublists. 

## Solution
The solution found by this search algorithm is displayed below where N is the input parameter for the search-function, w is the total weight (number of elements in the final list) and visited nodes are all the nodes that the search-algorithm visited before finding the minimal solution. 

|N|w|visited nodes|
|5|6|3|
|10|13|3|
|20|32|4|
|100|189|5|
|500|1375|7|
|1000|3087|8|
